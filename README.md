# ***Anaemia Prediction***
1. Decision Tree Classifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, and Random Forest Classifier all achieved a perfect accuracy score of 1.000, indicating they performed flawlessly on the given dataset. This suggests they were able to learn and predict the data with high precision.

2. Logistic Regression and GaussianNB achieved an accuracy score of 0.952, indicating they also performed well but were slightly less accurate compared to the top three classifiers. Despite this, they still demonstrated strong performance in predicting the dataset.

3. The models tested show varying degrees of performance, with Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest classifiers standing out for achieving perfect accuracy. Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, while slightly less accurate, still performed admirably. The choice of which model to use would depend on other factors such as interpretability, computational efficiency, and the specific requirements of the application.
